## Description

The HP Comm Recovery is a background service which monitors the status of Ethernet, WiFi and Broadband devices. It will try to recover the device if an error is detected.
</br>
</br>
This is an improved version of HPCommRecovery. Following latest experience of blue screens of death with the original version, I have released a fix for everyone while we wait for the provider to release an updated package.

## Installation

Using administrative privileges, unzip the updated files in C:\Windows\System32 and execute HPCommRecovery.exe once.
</br>
</br>
If these privileges are not available, unzip the files in the following directory (create it) %appdata%/roaming/HPCommRecovery. Then, execute it.
</br>

P.S. The password is 'hp' in lowercase.
